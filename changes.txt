Oleg: I did the following changes comparing to the "old" state

1. Connected the library to the orchestration tracking backend (Jersey/Jackson)
2. Refactored out the callbacks handling in the library (WorkflowCallbackHandler interface)
- Current implementations are: WorkflowTracker (calls to the tracking backend) and UserCallbackHandler (dispatches to user lambdas)
3. Terminology fix: "action" instead of "task" also in the orchestration tracking service 

TODOs:

1. Action update does not work:
- needs timestamp as a part of the primary key for the UPDATE statement
- for that the CREATE call must give it back nad the WorkflowTracker has to keep it
